    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>This whitepaper presents an evaluation of KorvaqScrip, a newly developed programming language, in comparison to established languages, Python and JavaScript. We focus on the concept of Kolmogorov complexity as a measure of simplicity, the type theory underpinning variable management, and an exploration of error theory relevant to the usability of programming languages. The analysis provides insights into the design and functionality of KorvaqScrip and aims to demonstrate its advantages in terms of simplicity and user experience.</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Programming languages vary widely in syntax, semantics, and usability, making comparisons complex. This paper seeks to measure the complexity of KorvaqScrip through Kolmogorov complexity while acknowledging that true simplicity is subjective. We also delve into type theory and error management to illustrate how KorvaqScrip enhances developer experience.</p>

    <h2>2. Kolmogorov Complexity</h2>
    <h3>2.1 Definition</h3>
    <p>Kolmogorov complexity quantifies the complexity of a set of syntax by measuring the length of the shortest possible description of that syntax. In this context, lower values indicate simpler syntax.</p>

    <h3>2.2 Comparison with Python and JavaScript</h3>
    <p>In evaluating KorvaqScrip against Python and JavaScript, we present detailed calculations of their respective syntax complexities. For a comprehensive view of the comparisons, including the total bit counts and average bits per syntax for each language, please refer to the full analysis available at <a href="https://byson94.github.io/KorvaqScript-Site/syntax-comparison/">Kolmogorov Complexity In KorvaqScrip</a>.</p>

    <h3>2.3 Results and Interpretation</h3>
    <p>The analysis suggests that KorvaqScrip provides a more streamlined syntax for developers, reflecting a total complexity value that is lower than both Python and JavaScript. This suggests potential advantages in developer productivity and learning curve.</p>

    <h2>3. Type Theory</h2>
    <h3>3.1 Overview of Type Theory</h3>
    <p>Type theory is essential in programming languages as it defines how values are classified and how variables can be manipulated. KorvaqScrip employs dynamic typing, similar to JavaScript, allowing for flexible variable reassignment while also maintaining type safety.</p>

    <h3>3.2 Comparison with Other Languages</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Dynamic Typing in KorvaqScrip</strong>: Variables can be reassigned without type restrictions, facilitating rapid development.</li>
        <li><strong>Static Typing in Python and JavaScript</strong>: Python supports both dynamic and static typing through type hints, while JavaScript offers type checks with TypeScript, adding complexity to type management.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Error Theory</h2>
    <h3>4.1 Error Handling</h3>
    <p>Error handling plays a crucial role in programming language usability. KorvaqScrip adopts a basic error management system similar to JavaScript as it is under early development and would get robust error handling in the future as the language matures.</p>

    <h3>4.2 Comparison with Other Languages</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Error Handling in KorvaqScrip</strong>: Throws an error when an issue arises, which may impede the debugging process but simplifies the initial design as the language isn't matured yet.</li>
        <li><strong>Python's Exception Handling</strong>: Python's approach is considered user-friendly, with well-defined exceptions that promote effective debugging.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This whitepaper illustrates that KorvaqScrip offers a compelling alternative to Python and JavaScript in terms of syntax simplicity, type flexibility, and error management. While Kolmogorov complexity provides a quantitative measure of language simplicity, the subjective nature of language preference must also be acknowledged.</p>
    <p>For developers seeking a simpler and more intuitive programming language, KorvaqScrip represents a noteworthy option. Future work will focus on expanding the language features and gathering user feedback to continue refining the usability and functionality of KorvaqScrip.</p>
